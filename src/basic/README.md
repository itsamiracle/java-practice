**Maskify** : write a function maskify, which changes all but the last four characters into '#' and returns it.

**PopulationGrowthCalculation** : In a small town the population is `p0 = 1000` at the beginning of a year. The population regularly increases by `2 percent` per year and moreover `50` new inhabitants per year come to live in the town. How many years does the town need to see its population greater or equal to `p = 1200` inhabitants?

**Encrption** : For building the encrypted string: Take every 2nd char from the string, then the other chars, that are not every 2nd char, and concat them as new String. Do this n times! Example:	`"This is a test!", 1 -> "hsi  etTi sats!"`.

**Persist** : Write a function, `persistence`, that takes in a positive parameter `num` and returns its multiplicative persistence, which is the number of times you must multiply the digits in `num` until you reach a single digit.

For example: `persistence(39) == 3 // because 3*9 = 27, 2*7 = 14, 1*4=4  and 4 has only one digit`

**BinaryArrayToNumber** : Given an array of one's and zero's convert the equivalent binary value to an integer. Example: [0, 0, 0, 1] is treated as 0001 which is the binary representation of 1
